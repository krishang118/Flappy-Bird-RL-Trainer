# Flappy Bird Q-Learning (RL) Trainer

A Q-learning based training implementation for the Flappy Bird gane, built using Pygame. The agent learns to play Flappy Bird through a trial-and-error-based reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) approach, improving its performance over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

## Usage

Run the training script:
```bash
python "Flappy Bird Training.py"
```

The agent will start learning to play Flappy Bird. The game window will display the current score, episode, epsilon (exploration rate), and best score achieved.
